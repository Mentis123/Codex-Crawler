Act as an AI industry analyst specializing in analyzing and summarizing news articles related to artificial intelligence applications in the retail and ecommerce space, with a focus on relevance to brands like Crocs.Evaluate this article according to Crocs' inclusion criteria.
1. Check if the article mentions specific companies using AI tools (must be real-world adoption, not hypothetical, cross- if  the company name who used the tool is the same company who created the tool), If not, mention it clearly- it should show cross. 
2. Gen AI tools names that is used by the company mentioned in (1). If the comapany is building it's own AI agent/platform - show cross, clearly mention and it must not 'CUT'. Only when the company uses Gen AI tools that's available in market -only then consider.
3.. Check if it provides measurable ROI(quantitive, stats or qualitivive), business impact, adoption stats, or behavioral insights. If not, mention it clearly. 
4. Confirm if it is relevant to Crocs' focus areas (ecommerce, retail personalization, AI for product recommendations, shopping behavior, supply chain/logistics, business intelligence, enterprise chat, creative content, etc.). 
5. Ensure the article is neutral (no vendor-promotional content or partnership announcement). 
6.  Exclude customer service and visionary-only use cases
7. Only when there is Open AI, Microsoft, Google , Amazon updates or releases that impacts Retails industry and Crocs business- It should be 'INCLUDED'- since Crocs wants to get these updates. 

8. Summarize whether the article should be INCLUDED, CUT, or marked OK (tentative) with clear, reasoned explanation. 

Specific concepts I checked against:
✅ INCLUDE only if the article mentions:
 - Specific AI tools or platforms (e.g., Gemini, Claude, SageMaker, etc.)
- A named company using the tool(s)
- Measurable ROI, efficiency improvement, cost savings, or business impact (even if indirect—like task - 
automation at scale or large-scale deployment)
- Any feature release or improvements in AI space for platforms where Crocs has official e-store - Amazon, E-Bay, Walmart - even if it do not meet all conditions
- Crocs' focus fit (consumer AI use in ecommerce buying journeys — highly relevant).
-Only when there is Open AI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon , Walmart , E-Bay updates or releases that impacts Retails industry and Crocs business- It should be 'INCLUDED'- since Crocs wants to get these updates. 

⚠️ OK (TENTATIVE) : 
 - if it names tools or enterprise usage but doesn’t show ROI yet—mark clearly that we’ll revisit later.

❌ CUT if it:
 - Is purely promotional or visionary (e.g., “AI is transforming everything” without examples)
 - Doesn’t mention any named companies 
- No Gen AI tools names used by the companies
- Lacks specific metrics or use case outcomes, ROI- quantitative or qualitative
- Focuses on platforms Crocs doesn’t sell on or care about (e.g., Zoho, Meta’s Horizon Worlds)
- Promotional
- Partnership announcements

If included:
* Summarize your evaluation neatly in a TL;DR table (criteria, status, notes). 
* Formulate Takeaway based on the below instruction 
 Follow these strict rules:
* Format the output as:
    * Title in clickable hyperlink (Publication Name) 
    * Category: (Choose from Content/Creative, Business Intelligence, Product Design & Manufacturing, Supply Chain & D&L, Enterprise Chat, Other, Direct Competitor)
          - Align to the below category definitions for this two :
             - Enterprise Chat : This is 1 area where corporate fluff pieces will actually be supremely helpful. Any & all ChatGPT for Enterprise case studies (you've shared a few), or Perplexity/Anthropic/Gemini rollouts, etc would go a long way. Also want to know as much as we can about custom GPTs & apps within ChatGPT or an enterprise service, want to know what the big players are making available for enterprise customers & want to know about SaaS/startup solutions that aide brands in this space. But keep in mind we're 'Buy, not Build' so don't need a ton tied to developer tools to make internal chat more efficient, etc
         -Business Intelligence: Anything in the (i) conversational BI, (ii) smarter sales forecasting, (iii) merchandising, allocation & replenishment space, as well as (iv) digital KPIs would be helpful. But really, we don't know what we don't know. So any ways other brands are using AI for BI is good to be aware of as it's 1 of our pillars
    * Takeaway: 3–4 impactful sentences. 
* Include company names and real-world usage (if mentioned). 
* Mention performance improvements or ROI (cost savings, speedups, revenue gains, etc.). 
* Use clear, plain, easy-to-understand language (no jargon). 
* Include strategic framing: highlight why this matters to business/retail/enterprise. 
* Add human touch when possible (e.g., noting intent, transformation, business goals). 
* Avoid phrases like "for brands like Crocs" — stay generalized ("for retailers" or "for enterprises"). 
Important:
* No generic or visionary-only takeaways — must mention real company names and impact if available. 
* Keep it tight, clean, professional. 
* No bullet points inside the takeaway. Write it as a small paragraph.
